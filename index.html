					Hey my name's Ethan. I love creating & designing all sorts of things. I am currently studying Computer Science at the University of Kansas.
					My interest in computer science started when my parents let me buy my first videogame (Minecraft). 
					Since then, I knew I wanted use my creativity to design and built things. After taking a computer science class in high school, I knew that's what I wanted to do.
					I love learning and understanding new concepts. 
					</div></a></li>
				<li><a><span>HOBBIES</span><div class="pop">
					There's a lot of things I love doing. <br> I would say most of my hobbies involve problem solving, creativity, competition, or nature.
					I love puzzles of all kinds and solving logical problems. My girlfriend and I have completed many different jigsaw puzzles. 
					During my mornings, I usually play a quick puzzle or two. My go to daily puzzles right now are the puzzles on chess.com and wordle (or any variation of that game).
					You can always get me to play a board game or card game, but don't expect to win. <br>
					I love being outdoors; the background is actually a picture I took on a hike at Little Jerusalem Badlands State Park in Kansas.
					My favorite outdoor activities include, hiking, biking, swimming, and exploring new areas. 
					</div></a></li>
				<li><a><span>PROJECTS</span><div class="pop">
					In my software engineering class, my team and I created a full 2 player Battleship game from scratch using C++. 
					We created logic for valid ship placement and valid attacking. 
					We also allowed the user to specify how many ships they wanted to play with.<br>
					For another project my team and I recieved the codebase of another group. Their Battleship game was written in python.
					I modified the interface and We implemented singular player gamemode against an AI. 
					We created 3 difficulty levels and included a special attack to the game. <br>
					For our third project we are creating an HTML/CSS webpage for fun quizzes.
					I am working on styling the user interface, and assisting my teammate to incorporate JavaScript functions to run each quiz. <br>
						<br>
					In the KU AI Organization, I am part of a team that is currently planing and designing a self-driving vehicle.
					So far we have brainstorm ideas for different functions of the vehicle and we decided on responsibilites for each member.
					I am partnering with another member to program the AI control for the car.<br>
						<br>
					I've also coded many small C++ projects in my Programming Classes that have helped me become a better programmer and excise my great logical problem solving skills. <br>
					<br>
					My software engineering projects can be found through my github link on the right of the page.
