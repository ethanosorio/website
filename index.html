					Hey, my name's Ethan. I love creating & designing all sorts of things. I am currently studying computer science at the University of Kansas.
					My interest in computer science started when my parents let me buy my first videogame (Minecraft). 
					Since then, I knew I wanted use my creativity to design and build things. After taking a computer science class in high school, I knew that's what I wanted to do.
					Coding offers a fun challenge where I can create whatever I can image. I love learning and understanding new concepts. 
					</div></a></li>
				<li><a><span>HOBBIES</span><div class="pop">
					There are a lot of things I love doing. <br> I would say most of my hobbies involve problem solving, creativity, competition, or nature.
					I love puzzles of all kinds and solving logical problems. My girlfriend and I have completed many different jigsaw puzzles. 
					During my mornings, I usually play a quick puzzle or two. My go-to daily puzzles right now are the puzzles on chess.com and Wordle (or any variation of that game).
					You can always get me to play a board game or card game, but don't expect to win. <br>
					I love being outdoors; the background is actually a picture I took on a hike at Little Jerusalem Badlands State Park in Kansas.
					My favorite outdoor activities include: hiking, biking, swimming, and exploring new areas.

				<li><a><span>PROJECTS</span><div class="pop">
					In my software engineering class, my team and I created a full 2 player Battleship game from scratch using C++. 
					We created logic for valid ship placement and valid attacking. 
					We also allowed the user to specify how many ships they wanted to play with.<br>
					For another project my team and I recieved the codebase of another group. Their Battleship game was written in Python.
					I modified the interface and we implemented singular player gamemode against an AI. 
					We created 3 difficulty levels and included a special attack to the game. <br>
					For our third project we created a webpage for quizzes.
					We started with making a prototype with a functional user interface and one quiz. We wanted to make the application generate a quiz from an input file.
					Eventually we decided to instead implement an API to generate quizzes for the page. <br>
						<br>
					I competed in HackKU2022. It was my first hackathon and I took the opportunity to play around with THREE.js to make a 3D site.
					Being completely new to the THREE.js library I spent a lot of time trying and testing different things. 
					I eventually was able to create a working model of a 3D puzzle cube. Check it out on my GitHub!<br>
						<br>
					In the KU AI Organization, I am part of a team that is currently planning and designing a self-driving vehicle.
					We started by brainstorming ideas for different functions of the vehicle and we decided on responsibilites for each member.
					I will be partnering with another member to program the AI control for the car. So far we have chosen and ordered parts for the vehicle.
					We assembled the hardware for the robot and next semester we will begin programming it.<br>
						<br>
					I've also coded many small C++ projects in my programming classes that have helped me become a better programmer and excercise my great logical problem solving skills. <br>
					<br>
					My software engineering projects can be found through my GitHub link on the right of the page.
